# Churn-Predictor-Machine-Learning

Developed a machine learning model achieving an 80% accuracy in predicting telecom subscription retention
employing Python libraries ( pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn ) for data manipulation and visualization.
<br> Utilized data segmentation into training and testing sets , executing diverse models ( linear regression, logistic
regression, decision trees) . Consistently attained a successful prediction rate of 75%+ across all models, ensuring
reliable churn forecasts.
